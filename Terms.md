I myself curerntly do not collect and upload any user data to the internet. The only data collection done is saving image to the Inventory but the image stays locally and is NOT uploaded to anywhere and it is deleted when you delete the image by either using the right click menu or by browsing the file through explorer and delete it there.

However, Microsoft Store might collect some information for analytic report or debugging information and for this you should go ahead and look at their privacy policy to see what they collected. you might also would like to check out the [Credits to NuGet packages used](./Credits.md) to see if the libraries used collect any personal data or not.
