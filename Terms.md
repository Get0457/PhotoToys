I myself curerntly do not collect and upload any user data to the internet. The only data collection done is saving image to the Inventory but the image stays locally and is NOT uploaded to anywhere. However, you might also would like to check out the [Credits to NuGet packages used](./Credits.md) to see if the libraries used collect any personal data or not.
